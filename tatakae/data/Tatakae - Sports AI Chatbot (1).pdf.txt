PROBLEM STATEMENT
AI in Sports:  Custom training program generation
Build a chatbot trained to take input parameters such as age, height, weight, gender, sport,
duration, goals, etc. and generate a training program for the athlete. 
Generate detailed training programs with exercises/drills, duration and frequency of workouts
for a wide variety of sports. 
Answer general questions on training regimes and their effectiveness for given goals. 

WHY?
Many athletes/trainers struggle to design custom, effective training programs.
Each sport and athlete’s physiology varies and generic programs online lack
personalization and adaptation.
There is thus a need for an intelligent chatbot that creates personalized, detailed
training programs and answers sports-related fitness queries.

A conversational chatbot that :
Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using data from
real research papers+ Mistral LLM for smarter, context-based
responses.
Is Personalized: Takes input parameters (age, gender, sport,
goals, etc.) and generates training plans (drills, frequency,
duration)
Answers training and performance-related queries — RAG
context retrieval.
Covers multiple sports — Use multi-sport dataset
SOLUTION + PLAN 

WHY MISTRAL LB?
Open-source and lightweight 
Free to deploy
High reasoning and instruction-following ability
Works efficiently with LangChain + RAG
Plan:
Use LangChain for orchestration
Connect Mistral (via Hugging Face API)
Use RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant training data before generation
